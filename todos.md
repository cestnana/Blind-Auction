# TODO-1: Ask the user for input

# TODO-2: Save data into dictionary {name: price}

# TODO-3: Whether if new bids need to be added

# TODO-4: Compare bids in dictionary

Clearing the Output
There are several ways of clearing the output. The easiest is to simply print "\n" many times so that the output scrolls down many lines.

e.g.

# This will add 20 new lines to the output
print("\n" * 20)

Functionality
Each person writes their name and bid.
The program asks if there are others who need to bid. If so, then the computer clears the output (prints several blank lines) then loops back to asking name and bid.
Each person's name and bid are saved to a dictionary.
Once all participants have placed their bid, the program works out who has the highest bid and prints it.
